# Movie Collection App
The Movie Collection App is a simple command-line application that allows users to manage a collection of movies. Users can add new movies to their collection, list all the movies they have, and find a movie by its title.

## Features

    Add a Movie: Users can add a new movie to their collection by providing the movie title, director, and release year.

    List Movies: Users can view a list of all the movies they have added to their collection, along with their titles, directors, and release years.

    Find a Movie: Users can search for a movie by its title and get information about the movie if it exists in their collection.

    Quit: Users can quit the application when they are done managing their movie collection.
